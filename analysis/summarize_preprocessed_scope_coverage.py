"""Summarise scope-aware coverage for the preprocessed annotations table.

This script inspects the canonical preprocessed per-message table
``annotations/all_annotations__preprocessed.parquet`` together with the
annotation metadata and reports:

* How many messages have all in-scope annotations scored (non-NaN).
* How many messages are missing at least one in-scope annotation score.
* A distribution of ``(in_scope_annotations, non_nan_scores)`` counts.

The intent is to provide a quick sanity check on coverage given the
annotation scopes before or after repair runs.
